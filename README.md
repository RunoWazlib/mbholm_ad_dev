Requires Python3, 3.11 preferred.

Install Python from python.org

`python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

`python -m pipenv install`

To activate a Python virtual environment created by `pipenv`:
`python -m pipenv shell`
or follow directions after the `pipenv install` command.

The `pipenv install` command creates a Pipfile and Pipfile.lock file that need to be committed to source control.

To add modules to the new Python environment:
`pipenv install <module>`
while in an active `pipenv shell` session.
